# Story 1.1: App Scaffolding & Data

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the basic app structure and data model in place,
**so that** core functionality can be built upon it.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new SwiftUI project named "Namely" is created.
2. The `Name` data model is created as a Swift struct.
3. A local JSON file (`names.json`) is included in the project resources.
4. A mechanism to load the names from the JSON file is implemented.
5. A way to store liked names locally is implemented.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Project Setup (AC: 1)**
    - [x] Create a new SwiftUI project in Xcode named "Namely".
- [x] **Task 2: Data Model (AC: 2)**
    - [x] Create a new Swift file `Name.swift` in the `Models` folder.
    - [x] Implement the `Name` and `Gender` structs as defined in the architecture.
- [x] **Task 3: JSON Data (AC: 3)**
    - [x] Create a `Resources` folder in the project.
    - [x] Add the `names.json` file to the `Resources` folder.
- [x] **Task 4: Data Loading (AC: 4)**
    - [x] Create a `NameViewModel.swift` in the `ViewModels` folder.
    - [x] Implement a function to load and parse `names.json` into an array of `Name` objects.
- [x] **Task 5: Local Storage (AC: 5)**
    - [x] Implement a mechanism in `NameViewModel.swift` to store an array of liked `Name` objects to `UserDefaults`.

## Dev Notes

### Data Models
- **`Name` struct:**
  ```swift
  struct Name: Identifiable, Codable {
      let id: UUID
      let name: String
      let origin: String
      let meaning: String
      let gender: Gender
  }

  enum Gender: String, Codable {
      case male, female, unisex
  }
  ```
  [Source: `docs/Namely_Data_Schema_and_Sample/name-struct-swift.md`]

- **`names.json` format:**
  ```json
  [
    {
      "id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-1234567890ab",
      "name": "Liora",
      "origin": "Hebrew",
      "meaning": "My light",
      "gender": "female"
    },
    ...
  ]
  ```
  [Source: `docs/Namely_Data_Schema_and_Sample/sample-json-data-namesjson.md`]

### Architecture
- **App Structure:** The main entry point will be `NamelyApp.swift`.
- **Folder Structure:**
  ```
  Namely/
   ├── Models/
   │    └── Name.swift
   ├── ViewModels/
   │    └── NameViewModel.swift
   ├── Resources/
   │    └── names.json
   └── NamelyApp.swift
  ```
  [Source: `docs/architecture/suggested-folder-structure.md`]
- **Data Handling:** Load `names.json` from the app bundle. Persist likes locally using `UserDefaults`. [Source: `docs/architecture/app-architecture.md`]

### UI Style
- No UI implementation is required for this story, but the basic style guide information is available for future reference.
- **Colors:** Background: `#FDFCFB`, Primary: `#FFB6B9` [Source: `docs/Namely_UI_Style_Guide/color-palette.md`]
- **Typography:** Font: SF Pro [Source: `docs/Namely_UI_Style_Guide/typography.md`]

## Testing
- No specific testing standards are defined in the architecture documents for this story.
- Manual verification of data loading and persistence will be required.

## Dev Agent Record
### File List
- `Namely/Models/Name.swift`
- `Namely/Resources/names.json`
- `Namely/ViewModels/NameViewModel.swift`
