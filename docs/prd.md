## 1. Problem Statement
Expecting couples often struggle to agree on a baby name due to differences in culture, heritage, taste, and emotional connection. They need a fun, lightweight, and non-confrontational way to discover and align on name choices together.

## 2. Goals
- Provide a delightful and simple baby name exploration experience  
- Help couples identify mutual favorite names  
- Support discovery with basic meaning and origin info  
- Enable shortlisting and partner match comparison  

## 3. Users
- Expecting couples (initially Juri & Jasna)  
- Age: 25–40  
- Tech-savvy, mobile-first  

## 4. Scope (MVP)

### ✅ Must-Have
- Swipe-based UI for names (like/dislike)  
- View name card (name, origin, meaning)  
- Local-only matching: show overlapping likes (e.g., toggle mode)  
- Simple shortlist of liked names  

### ⚠️ Nice-to-Have (for future or stretch goals)
- Audio pronunciation  
- Name map or category filters  
- Daily name suggestion  
- Export list (PDF/email/screenshot)  
- Shared code entry to compare partner matches  

## 5. Out of Scope
- Full backend or cloud sync  
- Social features or login  
- Complex filtering or analytics  
- Android/web platform  

## 6. Success Criteria
- App runs smoothly on iOS  
- Users can swipe through names and build a shortlist  
- Two users can compare shortlists manually  
- Discovering names feels enjoyable and frictionless
